    <h1>Jay Sampat</h1>
    

    <p>Hello, my name is Jay and I am a rising junior in high school. I currently attend Valley Christian High School and I am 16 years old. I live in San Jose, California, which isn't too far away from <span class="stanford">Stanford</span>. I have visited the <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> campus many times, and have loved the campus. I hope to attend as a student in the near future!</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching basketball, programming, and spending time with my friends. I have been a avid basketball fan for around 6-7 years and love watching the NBA. I have also been programming for 5-6 years, and hope to continue learning more about computer science in the near future. Lastly, I love spending time with my friends, whether they are friends I just met, or friends I have had for a long time. </p>

    <p>In school, my favorite subject is math. I love math because I have always been interested in the subject since a young age. Also, math comes easier to me than any other school subject, so I tend to enjoy math class. I also enjoy playing chess after school with some of my friends.</p>

    <p>Some of my hobbies include: </p>
