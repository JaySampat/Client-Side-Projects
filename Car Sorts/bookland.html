        "A portrait of the artist as a young man Description: This book is a fictional re-creation of the Irish writer's own life and early environment. The experiences of the novel's young hero, unfold in astonishingly vivid scenes that seem freshly recalled from life and provide a powerful portrait of the coming of age of a young man of unusual intelligence, sensitivity and character.",
        "This work displays an unusually perceptive view of British society in the early 20th century.It is a social comedy set in Florence, Italy, and Surrey, England. Its heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, struggling against straitlaced Victorian attitudes of arrogance, narroe mindedness and sobbery, falls in love - while on holiday in Italy - with the socially unsuitable George Emerson.", 
        "Allende describes the life of three generations of a prominent family in Chile and skillfully combines with this all the main historical events of the time, up until Pinochet's dictatorship.", 
        "The whole world of Irene Beltran, a young reporter in Chile at the time of the dictatorship, is destroyed when she discovers a series of killings carried out by government soldiers. With the help of a photographer, Francisco Leal, and risking her life, she tries to come up with evidence against the dictatorship."];
